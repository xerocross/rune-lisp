# RUNE LISP

I'm teaching myself Common Lisp. I can see how
incredibly powerful and amazing it is, but a lot
of the idioms are hideous, so ... because Lisp
lets you write your own idioms, that's what I'm
doing.

I present them to you as Rune Lisp. (The working
name for a while was Adam Lisp. You can use that
one if you like.)

I'm really **just** getting started, but I'm of
the 'commit early and often generation'. I haven't
written a license yet, but unless and until I
change my mind, you may consider everything in 
this repository (Rune Lisp) released into the 
public domain.
